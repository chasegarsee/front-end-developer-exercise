## Structure
Initially as I was reading down the README file I was getting excited to fire up the old create-react-app. Then I got to the * You should __not__ use a single-page application framework * part and life became real. This was a fun and great challenge as I have mostly just worked in React. 

## Annimations & Page Article Structure
All my animations were done in Javascript. I couldn't quite figure out how to make the articles hidden and the 
fade in fade out animation work at the same time without it. 

Without JS, the <a> tags basically just cause it to navigate to the id reference lower on the page. 

Added a position scroll to make it not look awful without the JS. 

## Browser
Looks to be working on all modern browsers including IE9. I am on a Mac so I had to go in to safari and simulate IE9. Again, looks to be functioning equally across all web browsers.

I did have some trouble with one font that wasnt wanting to play nice in safari but I slapped a  * -webkit * and * sans-serif * on there and it did the trick.
